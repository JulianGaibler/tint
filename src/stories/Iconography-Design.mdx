# Design & Export

Tint comes with a set of icons that can be used in the UI. Most icons are 20x20.
You can browse the icons in the
[Library](?path=/docs/iconography-library--docs).

## Design

The icons are designed on a 20x20 grid, altough the visual weight of the icons
should be contained in the center 16x16 area.

The stroke width of the icons is 2px and individual circles, for instance for
three dots, are 3px in diameter.

Icon badged are 7x7 and aligned to the bottom right corner of the 16x16 area,
with a 1px border radius and a 1px empty gap to the icon.

## Exporting icons

This is the process to export an icon to be used in tint. The process is aimed
at Adobe Illustrator, but can be adapted to other tools. Figma is not
recommended as it does not export compound paths as one path.

1. Hide all layers except for the icon
2. Select all parts of the icon
3. Outline Stroke (AI: `Path > Outline Stroke`)
4. Unite (AI: `Window > Pathfinder` then `Unite`)
5. Ungroup until all parts are separate (AI: `Object > Ungroup`)
6. (If there is more than one shape) Create a compound path (AI:
   `Object > Compound Path > Make`)
7. Save as SVG (AI: `File > Export > Export for Screens` select SVG format)
8. Run svgo on the SVG file
9. Remove unnecessary attributes from the SVG file (`id`, `data-name`,
   class`, `defs`)
10. Add `viewBox="0 0 XX XX"` and `width="XX"` and `height="XX"` to the SVG
    element (if not already present, XX is the size of the icon)
11. Add `fill="currentColor"` to the path element

Illustrator SVG export settings:

- Styling: Internal CSS (easiest to remove)
- Font: (irrelevant)
- Images (irrelevant)
- Object IDs: Minimal (easiest to remove)
- Decimal: 2
- Minify: unchecked
- Responsive: checked

## Size exceptions

Size exceptions are for specific use-cases (usually smaller icons).

- `check` is 14x14 to be used in a checkbox
- `dropdown` is 14x14 to be used in a dropdown button
