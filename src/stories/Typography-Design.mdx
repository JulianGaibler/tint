# Design

Typography! It's complicated! Tint tries to cover a broad range of use cases
while keeping the number of styles low. Some styles have been purposefully
omitted until they are needed. You can browse the available styles in the
[Library](?path=/docs/typography-library--docs).

## Typefaces

Tint uses two typefaces:
[Merriweather](https://github.com/SorkinType/Merriweather), a serif typeface,
and [HK Grotesk](https://hanken.co/products/hk-grotesk), a sans-serif typeface.

Whether to use a serif or sans-serif typeface is not enforced through the token
names, and generally depends on the context of where Tint is used. Yet there are
some guidelines that should be followed.

For interactive elements, like inputs, buttons and forms in general, a
sans-serif typeface should be used. By extension, user interfaces of apps and
extensions, in contrast to content pages, should use a sans-serif typeface.
Longer body texts, like blog posts, should use the serif typeface.

## Categories

The typography tokens are separated into multiple categories.

- **Display**: Very large text, used for hero text and other large headings.
- **Title**: Used for page titles, section titles, and other large headings.
- **Body**: Used for body text. Primarily aimed at blogs or informational sites.
- **UI**: Used for user interfaces that are denser, like extensions or apps.
- **Input**: Used for form input elements.
- **Action**: Used for buttons and other interactive elements.
