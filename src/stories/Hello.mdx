<h1>Hi!</h1>

Tint is the design foundation for my various projects, meant to be used for
websites, web apps, and extensions. As the word "foundation" implies, it's meant
to be the foundational layer for a variety of projects with different
requirements in terms of design and functionality.

This foundation was created after I realized I was re-implementing or
copy-pasting the same basic components, while having a hard time maintaining
multiple projects at once. I decided to create a design foundation that I can
use for all my projects, and maintain in a single place.

## What's in Tint?

Tint is organized into several modules that work together:

### Components

Tint provides a collection of Svelte components. These include form controls
(Button, TextField, Select, Slider), layout components (Modal, Menu,
SegmentedControl), and utility components (Autocomplete, LoadingIndicator,
ProgressBar).

All components are fully typed with TypeScript and designed to work with Tint's
typography and color system.

### Typography

Tint uses two typefaces:
[Merriweather](https://github.com/SorkinType/Merriweather) (serif) and
[HK Grotesk](https://hanken.co/products/hk-grotesk) (sans-serif). The typography
system includes type styles for display text, titles, body copy, UI elements,
inputs, and actions.

Fonts are included in WOFF2 format and can be selectively preloaded for optimal
performance using the `getFontPreloads()` helper.

### Styles

Tint uses SASS for styling, providing mixins for colors, typography, spacing,
and utilities. The special thing about Tint is that it provides tooling to have
two separate color palettes: one regular ("plain") and one "tinted" palette.

When using the Sass bootstrap function `generate-color-variables`, Tint users
can switch between the two color palettes by adding `.tint--plain` or
`.tint--tinted` to any HTML element. This makes it easy to create visual variety
or thematic sections within your project.

The styles also include a `.tint--type` prose class for styling long-form
content with standardized typography for headings, paragraphs, lists, code
blocks, and more.

### Icons

Tint includes a library of SVG icons in two sizes (14px and 20px). Icons can be
imported directly as modules and used in your Svelte or Astro components.

### Actions & Stores

In addition to the main modules, Tint provides helpful utilities:

- **Actions**: Svelte actions for common behaviors like tooltips and reorderable
  lists
- **Stores**: Svelte stores for managing grouped form controls (radio groups,
  checkbox groups)
