<h1>Hi!</h1>

Tint is the design foundation for my various projects, meant to be used for
websites, web apps, and extensions. As the word "foundation" implies, it's meant
to be the foundational layer for a variety of projects with different
requirements in terms of design and functionality.

This foundation was created after I realized I was re-implementing or
copy-pasting the same basic components, while having a hard time maintaining
multiple projects at once. I decided to create a design foundation that I can
use for all my projects, and maintain in a single place.

Tint provides SASS/SCSS variables and mixins for colors, typography, and
spacing, in addition to icons and a set of Svelte components. The special thing
about Tint is that it provides tooling to have two separate color palettes: one
regular one and one "tinted" one.

When using the Sass bootstrap function `generate-color-variables`, Tint users
can switch between the two color palettes by adding `.tint--plain` or
`.tint--tinted` to any HTML element.
