<h1>Hi!</h1>

Tint is the design foundation for my various projects, meant to be used for
websites, web-apps and extensions. As the word "foundation" implies, it's meant
to be the foundational layer for a variety of projects with different
requirements in terms of design and functionality.

This foundation got created after I realized I was re-implementing or
copy-pasting the same basic components, while having a hard time maintaining
multiple projects at once. I decided to create a design foundation that I can
use for all my projects, and that maintain in a single place.

Tint provides SASS/SCSS variables and mixins for colors, typography, and spacing
in addition to icons and a set of Svelte components. The special thing about
Tint is that it provides tooling to have two seperate color palettes: One
regular one and one "tinted" one.

When using the sass bootstrap function `generate-color-variables` tint users can
switch between the two color palettes by adding `.tint--plain` or `.tint--tinted`
to any HTML element.
